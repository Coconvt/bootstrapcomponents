                        The <i>PS1</i> is the first PlayStation ever released by Sony. It was released in Japan December
                        3rd, 1994, and in North America September 9th, 1995. Its design was minimal. It was just a gray
                        box with some detail around where you put the game disk. The second model of this console was
                        almost the same but a little smaller and contained less detail. The <i>PlayStation</i> was
                        designed by Sony Interactive Entertainment to compete with Nintendo’s Nintendo 64. Sony placed a
                        strong emphasis on 3D polygon graphics when creating the console’s design. This led them to not
                        include a dedicated processer for 2D graphics. The console was extremely popular thanks to its
                        extensive game catalog. This catalog included games from popular franchises such as Gran
                        Turismo, Crash Bandicoot, Tomb Raider, and Final Fantasy. All these games have had several
                        sequels. One of the most recent ones, Final Fantasy XVI was announced in June of this year. Not
                        only can this console play video games that were revolutionary at the time, but it can also play
                        CD’s. The Asian model (SCPH-5903) could even play video CD’s. It could do all the things that a
                        regular CD player could do. This includes playing songs from the CD in a programmed order,
                        shuffle the playback order, and repeat either one song or the entire disc. To honor this legacy
                        console, Sony released the PlayStation Classic on December 3rd, 2018. The purpose of this
                        console was to emulate old PlayStation games. It featured 20 pre-installed games including
                        Tekken 3, Final Fantasy VII, Jumping Flash!, and Syphon Filter.
